- üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
The emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has produced massive information related to COVID-19. Information distribution platforms such as mass media and social media allow information to be spread widely. Unfortunately, not all of the information is accurate or trustworthy. Some of the information spreading around those platforms can be categorised as misinformation or even be fake news.
Thus, this project aims to develop a complete set of strategies for multilingual COVID-19 fake news detection and intervention.



- üë©‚Äçüíª Our Missions:
  - To collect and analyse individual online behaviour characteristics in COVID-19 news propagation and communication in Australia and Indonesia.
  - To conduct theoretical analysis about the existing fake news detection models, and design a multilingual COVID-19 fake news detection model using advanced machine learning techniques
  - To apply the proposed COVID-19 fake news detection method to risk communication management to intervene in the spread of fake news, and help authoritative organisations to generate their customised COVID-19 warning policies.
